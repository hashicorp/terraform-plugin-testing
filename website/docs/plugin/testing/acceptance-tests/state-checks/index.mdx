description: >-
  State Checks are test assertions that can inspect state during a TestStep. The testing module
  provides built-in State Checks for common use-cases, and custom State Checks can also be implemented.

# State Checks

During the **Lifecycle (config)** [mode](/terraform/plugin/testing/acceptance-tests/teststep#test-modes) of a `TestStep`, the testing framework will run `terraform apply`.

The execution of `terraform apply` results in a [state file](/terraform/language/state), and can be represented by this [JSON format](/terraform/internals/json-format#state-representation).

A **state check** is a test assertion that inspects the state file. Multiple state checks can be run, all assertion errors returned are aggregated, reported as a test failure, and all test cleanup logic is executed.

Refer to:

- [Resource State Checks](/terraform/plugin/testing/acceptance-tests/state-checks/resource) for built-in managed resource and data source state checks.
- [Output State Checks](/terraform/plugin/testing/acceptance-tests/state-checks/output) for built-in output-related state checks.
- [Custom State Checks](/terraform/plugin/testing/acceptance-tests/state-checks/custom) for defining bespoke state checks.
