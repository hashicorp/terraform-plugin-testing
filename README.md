# terraform-plugin-testing

terraform-plugin-testing is a helper module for testing Terraform providers. Terraform acceptance tests use real Terraform configurations to exercise the code in real plan, apply, refresh, and destroy life cycles. 
When run from the root of a Terraform Provider codebase, Terraformâ€™s testing framework compiles the current provider in-memory and executes the provided configuration in developer defined steps, creating infrastructure along the way.
