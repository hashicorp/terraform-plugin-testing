## 1.6.0 (December 04, 2023)

NOTES:

* all: This Go module has been updated to Go 1.20 per the [Go support policy](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy). It is recommended to review the [Go 1.20 release notes](https://go.dev/doc/go1.20) before upgrading. Any consumers building on earlier Go versions may experience errors. ([#180](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-testing/issues/180))
* helper/resource: Configuration based `TestStep` now include post-apply plan checks for output changes in addition to resource changes. If this causes unexpected new test failures, most `output` configuration blocks can be likely be removed. Test steps involving resources and data sources should never need to use `output` configuration blocks as plan and state checks support working on resource and data source attributes values directly. ([#234](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-testing/issues/234))

FEATURES:

* plancheck: Added `ExpectUnknownOutputValue` built-in plan check, which asserts that a given output value at a specified address is unknown ([#220](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-testing/issues/220))
* plancheck: Added `ExpectUnknownOutputValueAtPath` built-in plan check, which asserts that a given output value at a specified address, and path is unknown ([#220](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-testing/issues/220))
* plancheck: Added `ExpectNullOutputValue` built-in plan check, which asserts that a given output value at a specified address is null ([#220](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-testing/issues/220))
* plancheck: Added `ExpectNullOutputValueAtPath` built-in plan check, which asserts that a given output value at a specified address, and path is null ([#220](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-testing/issues/220))

ENHANCEMENTS:

* helper/resource: Removed separate refresh commands, which increases testing performance ([#223](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-testing/issues/223))
* helper/resource: Automatically add `required_providers` configuration to `TestStep.Config` Terraform language configuration when using Terraform >= 1.0.* ([#216](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-testing/issues/216))

BUG FIXES:

* plancheck: Ensured `ExpectEmptyPlan` and `ExpectNonEmptyPlan` account for output changes ([#222](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-testing/issues/222))
* helper/resource: Ensured `TestStep.ExpectNonEmptyPlan` accounts for output changes with Terraform 0.14 and later ([#234](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-testing/issues/234))
