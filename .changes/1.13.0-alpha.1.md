## 1.13.0-alpha.1 (March 27, 2025)

NOTES:

* This alpha pre-release contains testing utilities for managed resource identity, which can be used with `Terraform v1.12.0-alpha20250319`, to assert identity data stored during apply workflows. A managed resource in a provider can read/store identity data using the `terraform-plugin-framework@v1.15.0-alpha.1` or `terraform-plugin-sdk/v2@v2.37.0-alpha.1` Go modules. To assert identity data stored by a provider in state, use the `statecheck.ExpectIdentity` state check. ([#470](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-testing/issues/470))
