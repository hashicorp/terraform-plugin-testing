body: 'helper/resource: Configuration based `TestStep` now include post-apply plan
  checks for output changes in addition to resource changes. If this causes
  unexpected new test failures, most `output` configuration blocks can be likely
  be removed. Test steps involving resources and data sources should never need
  to use `output` configuration blocks as plan and state checks support working
  on resource and data source attributes values directly.'
