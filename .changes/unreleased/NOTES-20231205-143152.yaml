kind: NOTES
body: 'helper/resource: Error messages generated by the testing logic, which were
  updated for clarity in this release, are not protected by compatibility promises.
  While testing logic errors are usable in certain scenarios with `ErrorCheck`
  and `ExpectError` functionality, error messaging checks should be based on
  provider-controlled messaging or when appropriate to use other testing
  features such as `ExpectNonEmptyPlan` instead.'
