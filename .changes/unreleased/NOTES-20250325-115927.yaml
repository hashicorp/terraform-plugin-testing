kind: NOTES
body: This alpha pre-release contains testing utilities for managed resource identity, which can be used with `Terraform v1.12.0-alpha20250319`, to
    assert identity data stored during apply workflows. A managed resource in a provider can read/store identity data using the `terraform-plugin-framework@v1.15.0-alpha.1`
    or `terraform-plugin-sdk/v2@v2.37.0-alpha.1` Go modules. To assert identity data stored by a provider in state, use the `statecheck.ExpectIdentityValue` state check.
